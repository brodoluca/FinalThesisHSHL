\section{Future work}
For the purpose of this paper, only techniques related to measuring execution time have been described. However, benchmarks are also used to measure other metrics, such us energy consumption or memory use. It is left for future work to find better techniques to precisely measure and monitor them, as they are also of the highest importance especially for smaller devices. \\
In addition, this paper focused mostly on UNIX operating systems, therefore purposely neglecting other operating systems and micro-controllers. The study of measurements techniques is also left for future work. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The models are not optimize
\item What happens with different models
\item What happens with different parameters
\item What happens in different devices
\item What happens with model that we create
\item What happens with different datasets, maybe imprecise 
\item Can we identify different characteristics?
\item Can we identify different correlations?
\item Can we optimize applications with it?
\end{itemize}
