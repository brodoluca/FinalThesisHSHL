\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Future work}
For the purpose of this paper, only techniques related to measuring execution time have been described. However, benchmarks are also used to measure other metrics, such us energy consumption or memory use. It is left for future work to find better techniques to precisely measure and monitor them, as they are also of the highest importance especially for smaller devices. \\
In addition, this paper focused mostly on UNIX operating systems, therefore purposely neglecting other operating systems and micro-controllers. The study of measurements techniques is also left for future work.
